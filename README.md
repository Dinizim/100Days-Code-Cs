## 4 Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Abstraction:
- Representation of real-world objects through classes.
- Use of classes to create objects, avoiding code repetition.
- Envisioning the actions of the object in the system, considering identity, properties, and methods.
   - **Identity:** Unique name for the object.
   - **Properties:** Characteristics such as name, size, color.
   - **Methods:** Actions or events, such as turnOn(), run(), turnOff().
- Abstract classes deepen abstraction by hiding implementation details from classes that do not need to know them.

### Inheritance:
- Enables the creation of a class that inherits characteristics and functionalities from another.
- Practical example with the Animal, Tiger, and Monkey classes, where the subclasses share properties and methods of the Animal class.

These are two of the four fundamental pillars of OOP, contributing to the creation of efficient and modularized systems.
